# Welcome!
This code goes with a series of tutorials I am wrting on my blog <a href="https://fenchurchtech.com/libgdx-tutorials/">FenchurchTech.com</a>.   My goal with these tutorials is to build a breakout-style block breaker game.   I selected LibGdx as my game framework for two reasons.  First, at least for me it more accessible than Unity.  Secondly, deploying the final game was easier than using a framework like PyGame.  Being able to generate mobile and desktop versions of a game off a single set of core files was big for me.   com.
